            <p>We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in mind. That's why we believe it's always
                worth
                trying to
                fix a system before outright replacing it, wherever possible â€“ it requires fewer materials and is easier
                on
                the planet,
                as well as your wallet! If another company tells you that your system needs to be replaced, just give us
                a
                call and
                we'll see if we can repair it first.</p>

                    accessible to
                    everyone, so we price ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more affordable. We're focused on
                    helping you and on
                    helping the environment, rather than on turning a profit.</p>

                    greener, more
                    eco-friendly approach to power. The world of green energy can be jargon-filled and opaque, so we
